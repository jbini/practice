                            We had a good thing going lately
                            Might not have always been a fairy tale
                            But you know and I know
                            That they ain't real
                            I'll take the truth over the story
                            You might've tried my patience lately
                            But I'm not about to let us fail
                            I'll be the wind picking up your sail
                            But won't you do something for me?

                            Coming and going
                            Inside out

                            There's no life, without love they say
                            None worth having anyway
                            You're a mystery to me some days
                            That's what keeps me sane
                            A heart that yearns is always young
                            But you can't love just anyone
                            It's been a while since 21
                            But I still feel the same
                            Take me home and don't spare the horses
                            Away to a silence I need
                            Take me home and don't spare the horses
                            Away to a gossamer breeze
                            I don't need to build a house of stone
                            Wherever you are is where I call home
                            'Cause we're just you and me
                            We drink and laugh and dance 'til three
                            I have everything I need when I'm with you alone
                            Home is where we stay all night
                            No roof above our starry sky
                            I'd lie here 'til the day I die
                            And our time together's flown
                            So, take me home and don't spare the horses
                            Away to a silence I need
                            Take me home and don't spare the horses
                            Away to a gossamer breeze
                            I don't need to build a house of stone
                            Wherever you are is where I call home
                            And I know I've made mistakes at times
                            Every now and then I've made you cry
                            For that I'm sorry
                            They were few and far between
                            We're closer now than we've ever been
                            You know I'm sorry
                            I used to wonder why I'm here
                            No rhyme no reason would appear
                            Since we've met, it's loud and clear
                            I'm here to see you home

                            We'll play Nintendo

                            We'll watch The Notebook
                            For the 17th time
                            I'll say "It's stupid"
                            Then you'll catch me crying
                            We're not making out
                            On a boat in the rain
                            Or in a house I've painted blue

                            And lock all the doors
                            We're not looking for no one
                            Don't need nothing more
                            You'll bite my lip and
                            I'll want you more
                            Until we end up in a heap on the floor
